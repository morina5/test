# Part 1: Claim Analysis

Siegel, D., 2015. What I Learned about Climate Change: The Science is not Settled. Medium. Available at: <https://pullnews.medium.com/what-i-learned-about-climate-change-the-science-is-not-settled-1e3ae4712ace> [Accessed 24 Oct. 2021].

This blog post was written in 2015 by blogger and businessman David Siegal. The article in question claims that there probably is no climate crisis and that the focus on carbon dioxide emissions takes funding and attention from other critical environmental problems. The reason I chose this article for examination is because it is formatted as a well-structured essay, making claims and providing evidence with accompanying sources as he builds his argument from the ground up. At face value, this essay presents itself very well and garnered a great deal of attention, receiving over 250 000 views online. He prefaces his arguments by saying he once thought that climate science was settled on a consensus but has since had his views change drastically on the matter. Siegel makes it clear that his target is to convince members of the general public that anthropogenic climate change is neither real nor important, and that the decarbonization of the economy will not solve anything.

The essay begins by postulating 10 short statements that challenge the beliefs of modern science embodied by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). I will be evaluating the claims made within this article by applying the principles for evaluating information sources to see if some of the more bolder claims made in this article hold up against scientific scrutiny.

A major claim made by Siegel in this article is that “Most of what people call “global warming” is natural. The earth is warming, but not quickly, not much, and not lately.” Siegel also claims that CO₂ has little impact on climate and “All the decarbonization we can do isn’t going to change the climate much.” After years of closely monitoring the global temperature over land and seas, it is clear that Earth is actually warming very quickly on a relative timescale (Met Office Hadley Centre, 2016) and is directly correlated to increasing levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, specifically CO₂ (Rohling et al., 2012). The 5th report from the IPCC concludes that human activity has been the dominant cause of warming in the past century (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, 2014a). The report states that the global mean of surface temperature is approximately 1°C higher than that of Earth in 1850 (see Figure 1).

Another claim made by Siegel is that “Climate models are not yet skillful; predictions are unresolved.” This statement shows a lack of understanding of climate models and scientific uncertainty. A skillful model is not necessarily 100% accurate, but will reveal some information or trend that we wouldn’t know otherwise. A prime example of a skillful climate model is the prediction made by Hargreaves (2010) of future warming in response to increasing anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. 

David Siegel is not a climate scientist, he is the CEO of a blockchain innovation community, meaning that he is not an expert in a position to educate the public about climate change. He demonstrates a clear and intentional distrust in science by saying that highly regarded scientific institutions such as NASA, NOAA, and the IPCC, are not to be trusted. By rejecting all mainstream science, his most trusted sources include a science fiction author named Michael Crichton, blogs that promote climate conspiracy theories, as well as political organizations which promote misinformation about climate science. Siegel demonstrates his bias by selectively paying attention to the voices and data that support his worldview, showing that he is not skeptical, but anti-science.
